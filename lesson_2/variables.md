# Python variables

Programming languages make use of variables. Variables are also often seen in regular math. A simple example
is the formula `8 * x = y`. `x` and `y` can be a wide variety of numbers. Python variables are not limited to
numbers, they can hold other data types. 

Python variables can simply be seen as names referring to pieces of data. This data can then change during the programs lifecycle.

Take a look at the [example script](variables.py) and try running the script to see the results.
